# OptimizingGraduationRates
A model which seeks to optimize graduation rates for schools
In this project, we consider existing data on variables which affects high school graduation rates in Colorado. Specifically, we are considering student teach ratio, average teacher salary, demographic disparity between teachers and students, and several others. This data is used to build a model to maximize the graduation rates of students in its purview. This model is solved using linear programming techniques. This would provide these institutions with a powerful tool for adjusting current budget usage and other resource allocation, relying on existing data. In order to demonstrate this model and the results it provides for decisions, we have created a mock school based on average constraints for budget, number of students, and other considerations from the state of Colorado. Ultimately this will provide an optimized distribution of resources and other policy questions.
